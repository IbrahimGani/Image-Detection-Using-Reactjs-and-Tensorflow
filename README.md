# Image-Detection-Using-Reactjs-and-Tensorflow
The goal of this project is to develop a web application using ReactJS that can perform object detection in images using TensorFlow.js and the Coco SSD (Common Objects in Context) model. The Coco SSD model is a pre-trained model that can identify and localize multiple objects in an image.
